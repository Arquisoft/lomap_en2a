== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== _Domain model_

This is the actual state of the domain model, which will change along the development:

[plantuml,Domain model,png]
----
class Map
    Map : - locations : ListOfLocations<Location>

class Location
    Location : - latitude : double
    Location : - longitude : double    
    Location : - name : String
    Location : - description : String
    Location : - reviews : ListOfLocations<String>

    Location : + getLatitude() : String
    Location : + getLongitude() : String
    Location : + getName() : String
    Location : + getDescription() : String

class User
    User : maps : ListOfLocations<Map>
    User : friends : ListOfLocations<User>


Map <-- "*" Location
User "1" *--> "*" Map 
User --> "*" User
----

=== _Architecture and design patterns_

.Architecture pattern: MVC
We will use the MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern, which is very commonly used for developing applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Both desktop and web applications use ir. It is simple but powerful, allowing us to separate the application in three different but interconnected parts or layers:

* Model: contains the core functionality and data. It contains the data that the View layer will represent
* View: displays information to the user. It passes the input information to the Controller layer.
* Controller: handles the inputs from the users. It communicates with the Model layer.

.Design pattern: Adapter
We will use this pattern when working with the geolocalization API. We chose to use Google Maps for this, but maybe in the future we want or have to change it. To prevent and minimize the impact such a change could have in our application, we will use an Adapter pattern. This way only a few changes will be necessary in our code.

=== _Rules for using specific technology_

Right now we now little about the technologies we are going to use. Once we learn more about them more content will be added to this section.

.Rules:

* Always make a _git pull_ before getting to work. This will prevent possible problems in the repository.
* Never make a _commit_ to the master branch.
* Never merge a branch into another by yourself. Create always a _pull request_ so the rest of the team can check the changes and approve them.

=== _Implementation rules_

These are rules to be considered when implementing our code:

* Write in English the names of all the functions, variables, etc.
* Never get the responsabilities of the different layer of the MVC pattern mixed (no UI outside View, no database access outside Model...).

=== _User Experience (UX)_

We want to have adaptable so it can be used in different devices. We also want it to have accessible interfaces, so we have to be careful with the use of colors, alternative texts and more details.
