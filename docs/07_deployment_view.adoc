== Deployment View
An overall structure of the application is presented in this section. The following diagram illustrates the structure:

We will go one by one through all the different subsystems identified in the diagram with the big boxes explaining each of the components or elements that they are composed of. These sections also outline the relationships between these subsystems, and how they interact with each other to deliver the desired functionality. This information is critical for ensuring that our system is properly deployed and configured in order to meet the requirements and goals of our stakeholders.

=== LoMap hosting server
In this section we will cover in depth the architecture for the hosting server of the application. The server will contain mainly one element: the application itself.

==== LoMap hosting server - Application
The LoMap application will be the heart of the whole system, serving as the interface for users to interact with the stored data. In this section, we will discuss the deployment options for the application, including whether it will run natively on the server or if we will use a containerization solution such as Docker to simplify deployment. The choice of deployment option will depend on various factors such as scalability, ease of maintenance, and security concerns.

=== Map Service Provider
This section of the diagram represents the API used to include the map view to the application. The map API to be used is Google maps API, which will serve just fine for the application requirements.

=== User computer
In this section we will delve into the architecture of the end-user environment, which is the final link in the deployment of the LoMap application. The user computer, which serves as the main interface between the user and the LoMap application, is composed of two main components: the web client and the SOLID component. These components play a crucial role in ensuring that the user experience is seamless and efficient. In this section, we will examine each component in detail, discussing how they contribute to the overall deployment of the LoMap application.

==== User computer - Web Client
In the diagram the web client represents the browser from which the user will make the requests to the application, this client will connect to the hosting service and serve as a mean of communication with the user. Application is expected to be independent to all web clients so this element is not considered as a key element of the system.

==== User computer - SOLID element
We call this element "SOLID element" and not pod since we are abstracting the concept of the SOLID pod to be a whole subsystem. Pod can be stored in a private local place on the client machine or may be stored in a SOLID pod provider. Application should be able to abstract both cases and use the pod as a source of information in either way.

The following image illustrates the two possibilities application will have to face to obtain user`s pod data.
