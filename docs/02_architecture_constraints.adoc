== Architecture Constraints
When designing the LoMap application, there are several constraints that must be taken into consideration. These constraints will have a significant impact on the overall design of the application and the architectural decisions that are made. The constraints include privacy, performance, user experience, deployment, security,... These constraints must be considered in order to ensure that the final product meets the needs and expectations of the users and stakeholders. The following table summarizes these constraints and provides a brief explanation for each.

| Constraint | Explanation

| Privacy (use of SOLID) | The privacy of the users is a key concern, and the application should be designed to respect the privacy of users. The information stored in each userâ€™s pod should not be centralized and should be kept confidential.

| Performance | The application should perform well and should be scalable to handle large amounts of data.

| User Experience | The user experience should be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to add, edit, and delete locations, as well as manage their friends and personal information, this means application will support connection between friends.

| Deployment | The application should be deployable to different cities.

| Test coverage | Code must meet a good test quality and coverage to ensure the expected outcome.
