== Building Block View
The building block view shows in a graphic way a decomposition of the system. 

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System
Main view of the system. The Lomap application is related to two external components: the Solid Provider and the Google Maps API.
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Motivation::
This is a general overview of the application. Here it can be seen the external services that will be used and the interaction between them.


Contained Building Blocks::
* **LoMap.** It's the main application, represented as a whitebox that will be detailed in the following decompositions. 
* **Google Maps API.** It's the external API used by the system to achieve the map functionalities.
* **Solid Provider.** System to which the application is going to rely on for the storage of data.

****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.

=== Level 1

The main application. It interacts with the external services and provides the user a GUI to interact with the system. It is composed by a single module representing the web application.

==== White Box _System_

_**Overview Diagram**_

image:level1BuildingBlocks.jpg["White Box System"]

Motivation::

First decomposition of the system. It shows the webapp module as a whitebox. Also displays the docs module which contains the documentation of the project.


Contained Building Blocks::

* **Webapp.** It's the main module of the application. It interacts with the external components to build the whole system.
* **Docs.** It's the module of the project devoted to provide all the documentation of the application. It won't be decomposed any further.

Fulfilled requirements::

* The fact of not having a database connected to the system totally fulfills the requirement about the decentralization of the information, as all data will be privately and securetly stored in each user's pod.

=== Level 2

The webapp module is the core of the application. It contains all the components that make up the web and all the interactions with the external libraries. In its contents we can differentiate the following directories: src, e2e and public.

==== White Box _System_

_**Overview Diagram**_

image:level2BuildingBlocks.jpg["White Box System"]

Motivation::

Core of the application. It is reponsible of all the processes and functionalities fulfilled by LoMap.

Contained Building Blocks::

* **Src.** Directory containing all the React components, Solid interaction and the project's unit tests.
* **e2e.** Contains the end-to-end testing of the application using the Cucumber software tool.
* **Public.** Contains files that will be used as the entry point for the React application in a web browser

=== Level 3

Decomposition of the src directory. This directory contains the source code and assets for the web application: css and typescript files along with images and static assets.

==== White Box _System_

_**Overview Diagram**_

image:level3BuildingBlocks.jpg["White Box System"]

Motivation::

This folder serves as the central location for storing all the components of the application. It provides a well-organized and easy-to-navigate structure for the development team, allowing them to quickly find and modify the files they need, as well as providing an easy-to-maintain structure.

Contained Building Blocks::

* **Solid.** Contains all the source code utility for the conections with the pod provider. Provides a general file responsible for all the exchange of information between the application and the solid pod.
* **Components.** Contains all the React components displayed to the user. Basically represents the GUI and the logic of the interfaces interactions.
* **Static.** Contains files that are not processed by the build system or the application itself.
* **Tests.** Contains all the unit tests of the system, which are responsible for the coverage percentage.
* **Types.** Folder containing all the types used in the application to represent the different entities of the system.
