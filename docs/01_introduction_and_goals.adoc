== Introduction and Goals
LoMap consists on an application where you can access to a map and add markers, routes and share it with your friends. 

It's being developed by software architecture students during 2023. 

It follows SOLID principles, ensuring privacy and availability of the data.

=== Requirements Overview
The application shows a map of a city or place. Each user is able to modify it's map to customize and personalized. The users can personalize it's maps by adding 
markers, which can define bars, restaurants, sights, or points of interests from the city. This markers are stored, so that each user, by login in, can access to his personal map.

This storage will be handled according to the SOLID principles.

It's also possible to personalize a map of every city, since this app is not limited by a region or country, and can be accessed from anywhere.

.Requirements: 
* Add different categories for each location
* See the locations in a map in form of markers
* Interact with markers adding photos, reviews or comments.
* Manage a list of friends.
* Manage the information that is shared with your friends.
* See the locations created by friends.
* Filter the locations of the map by categories.

There are also some optional features which, by today, are still not defined whether if they'll be done or not. This can be seen in the https://arquisoft.github.io/course2223/labAssignmentDescription.html#OPTIONAL[Lab assingmnent]

| Goal | Description

| Security | Each user should access to it's pod and it can not be accessed by other user. User can modify their access data.

| Performance | The application should be able to give short response time when users are interacting with it. 

| Availability | The personal data from the pods can be accessed at any time.

| Usability | The application should be easy to use. This can be achieved by using different technices such as familiarity, learnability, etc.

| Portability | The application must work regarding the device, since it will be developed as a web application.

| Testability | There must be tests for the application in order to check it's correct behavior.
