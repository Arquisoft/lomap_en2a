== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== _Domain model_

This is the actual state of the domain model, which will change along the development:

[plantuml,Domain model,png]
----
class Map
    Map : - locations : List<Location>
    Map : + sharedLocations : List<Location>

class Coordinates
    Coordinates : - lng : Number
    Coordinates : - lat : Number

class Location
    Location : - url : string
    Location : - name : string
    Location : - description : string
    Location : - category : Array<string>
    Location : - rating : Map<string,Number>
    Location : - images : Array<string>
    Location : - imagesAsFile : Array<File>

class Review
    Review : - webId : string
    Review : - date : string
    Review : - title : string
    Review : - content : string
    Review : - username : string

class User
    User : name : string
    User : email : string

class Friend
    Friend : username : string
    Friend : webID : string
    Friend : pfp : string



Coordinates *--> "1" Location
Review *--> "*" Location
Map "1" *--> User
Friend "*" --> User

=== _Architecture and design patterns_

.Just front-end and SOLID
We decided to not use a restapi (back-end). This means our application will operate only with a front-end together with SOLID.

=== _Rules for using specific technology_

Right now we now little about the technologies we are going to use. Once we learn more about them more content will be added to this section.

.Rules:

* Always make a _git pull_ before getting to work. This will prevent possible problems in the repository.
* Never make a _commit_ to the master branch.
* Never merge a branch into another by yourself. Create always a _pull request_ so the rest of the team can check the changes and approve them.

=== _Implementation rules_

These are rules to be considered when implementing our code:

* Write in English the names of all the functions, variables, etc.
* Never get the responsabilities of the different layer of the MVC pattern mixed (no UI outside View, no database access outside Model...).

=== _User Experience (UX)_

We want to have adaptable so it can be used in different devices. We also want it to have accessible interfaces, so we have to be careful with the use of colors,
alternative texts and more details.

After doing some usability tests, we found that the application was not very friendly with new users.
A viable solution we came to was the implementation of a tutorial. This tutorial uses texts and GIFs to
show the user how to do basic actions in the application like how to add a location, check your added locations,
add a friend...

Internationalizing the application was discussed during the development, but in the actual version of the application,
it is not yet implemented. The application is only available in English.

=== _Development concepts_
.Testing
We have tested the application with different tests:

* Unit testing: with the help of the SonarCloud tool to keep track of the code covered by these tests. The Continuous Integration practice was applied with GitHub Actions.
* Acceptance tests with Cucumber: tests that are meant to be ran in front of the client. They were developed using user stories, which are simple and easy to understand. We applied the Behaviour-Driven Development.
* Usability tests: with the help of people we know (family and friends), we tested our application usability.
    Thanks to these tests, we found that some people had problems, and we decided to add a tutorial that people can check.
    This way, they'll learn what can they use LoMap for, and how to use it.
* Load tests: to measure the performance of the application while many users use it. The tool Gatling was used.

.Deployment
The application will be deployed to GitHub Pages.

.Configurability
The application will not have configurable features. An early idea was to include a "dark mode".
Through the development we decided to postpone these ideas in order to focus on a better application in general.
