== Architecture Constraints
When designing the LoMap application, there are several constraints that must be taken into consideration, as they will have a significant
impact on the overall design of the application and the architectural decisions. 
These constraints must be considered in order to ensure that the final product meets the needs and expectations of the users and stakeholders. 
The following table summarizes these constraints and provides a brief explanation for each one.

|===
| Constraint | Explanation

| Privacy (use of SOLID) | The privacy of the users is a key concern, for that, the application is decentralized and the information stored in each userâ€™s pod is kept confidential.

| Version control and monitoring (GitHub) | For the LoMap application, GitHub is a useful tool for version control and collaboration among the team members working on the project. It allows easier coordination and organization of the development process, as well as keeping track of changes and contributions made by each team member.

| User Experience | The design of the application must make its use friendly and easy.

| Deployment | The application should be deployable to different cities.

| Test coverage | Code must meet a good test quality and coverage to ensure the expected outcome.

=== Recommended technologies to take into account
There some technologies mentioned to provide readers with a clear understanding of this application and how it works. 
These are not considered constraints since they were not imposed, but given the strong impact they have, the team considered that they should be presented in this section.

| Technology | Explanation

| Google Maps API | Collection of APIs that allows developers to integrate Google Maps into their applications. Also provides developers with access to a range of features and functionality related to maps and location-based services.

| NodeJS | JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. This allows to use TypeScript language from the server side.

| React | JavaScript library that allows the creation of web application UI in an easy way. The user interface of our application was built using react componentes and libraries.

| Inrupt | Platform (and SOLID pod provider) that allows a secure and decentralized way to store and share data. Also offers a set of libraries to ease the use and management of pods.
