== Introduction and Goals
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. These include

* underlying business goals, essential features and functional requirements for the system
* quality goals for the architecture
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
The Council of Brussels has hired the company HappySw, which consists in software architecture students from Oviedo, to develop an application called LoMap.
With LoMap you can access to a map and add markers, routes and share it with your friends. 
Our goal is to develop an application that fullfills the requirements and good quality standards, following SOLID principles ensuring privacy and availability of the data.


=== Requirements Overview
LoMap is a desktop application which allows users to have a customized map about places and local businesses in their city, although it can be scalable
to any place in the world. These locations can have images, reviews, scores... and can be categorized into shops, bars or museums among others.

All information is stored in a pod under the full control of the user, as LoMap is developed following the guidelines of the Solid Project. However, this is not
an impediment for the users to share their places with friends, since LoMap implements the friend system of Solid and lets the user decide which information is going to be
shared and which is going to be private.

==== Functional requirements 
.The user will be able to: 
* Manage their locations: add, delete and edit.
* Add different categories for each location.
* See the locations in the map in form of markers.
* Interact with the locations adding photos, reviews or ratings.
* Manage a list of friends.
* Manage the information that is shared with his friends.
* Keep track of their progress in the application in a gamified way.
* Filter locations based on categories and friends.

.The system will:
* Store the information about each user's places in their Solid pods, not centralized. 
* Allow users to see their own and their friends' markers.
* Offer the user an interactive guide to provide guidance and training on the app functionalities.

| Performance | The application is able to give reasonable response times when users are interacting with it. 

| Availability | The personal data from the pods can be accessed at any time.

| Usability | The application is easy to use.

| Portability | The application works regarding the device, since it is developed as a web application.

| Testability | Tests are developed for the application in order to check it's correct behavior.
