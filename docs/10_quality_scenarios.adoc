== Quality Requirements


[role="arc42help"]
****
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2 Quality Goals. With this specification, we aim to represent all the identified quality attributes in order to be able to satisfy the needs of the stakeholders of this project.

****

=== Quality Tree

The quality tree uses "quality" as the root while the rest of the quality categories will be displayed as branches.

=== Quality Scenarios


.Contents
To have a measurable response of the system regarding some stimulus corresponding to the different quality branches described in the mindmap, we will use quality scenarios. The purpose of these quality scenarios is to make the requirements concrete and traceable. Firstly, we will denote the quality goal, followed by its motivation, usage scenario and priority. Given the fact that at this point of the development we did not encounter any change scenarios, they would not be added until the second version of the documentation. 

*Usage scenarios*

|===
| Quality goal | Motivation | Usage scenario | Priority

| *Portability* 
| To reach the maximum number of users the application must work in the maximum number of infrastructures. 
| When users access the web from different browsers and devices, it must work and provide all the possible functinalities.
| Very high

| *Testability* 
| All features of the application must be testable in order to verify that the web built was the one asked for.
| The unit tests passed by the developers must generate an observable output and have at least 90% coverage.
| Very high

| *Security*
| Our web must be secure not only to protect data but to provide a realiable solution to our users. If we can't assure our clients the web is secure, no one will use it.
| Data will be only accessible by its owner. If a user tries to access other people's information, the system will deny the operation, as data will be stored in a secure system.
| Very high

| *Performance*
| The application must have a short response time. Slow applications are not positively popular in society.
| The application must be able to bear at least 20 concurrent users and give a response time to their actions in less than 5 seconds.
| High

| *Availability* 
| The application must be available 24 hours a day all weeks. 
| When the database does not respond, the system should log the fault and respond with stale data in less than 5 seconds
| High

| *Availability* 
| The application must be available 24 hours a day all weeks. 
| When a user adds elements of any type to its map, the element will be added 99% of the time on average over the course of the year.
| High

| *Usability* 
| To make the website stand out from the competition, it must be easy to use, familiar, aesthetic, consistent... 
| When the user wants to do something in the application, he/she should be able to do it without difficulty, guided by the interface elements.
| Very high

|*Reliability*
| Errors must be managed by the application itself. It can't crash without any solution.
| When a user introduces wrong data or tries to perform not authorized actions, the system will handle the errors without crashing.
| Very high

*Change scenarios*

|===
| Quality goal | Motivation | Change scenario | Priority
| *Maintainability*
| An application should be maintainable to remain usable over the years and to be able to improve functionalities and to fix misfunctionalities.
| When developers must introduce a new feature to the web, they should be able to do it without changing the software architecture.
| High

| *Maintainability*
| An application should be maintainable to remain usable over the years and to be able to improve functionalities and to fix misfunctionalities.
| When developers must fix errors and bugs on the system, they should be able to do it without major consequences on the system.
| High
