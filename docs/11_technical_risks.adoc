== Risks and Technical Debts

This section contains a list of identified risks that the project will face during its lifetime. In addition to it, each particular risk comes with a brief 
self-explanatory description, the probability of its occurrence, its impact on the project and a solution on how to minimize it or mitigate it.

=== 11.1 Risks
[options="header", cols="2, 3, 1, 1, 3"]
|===
| Risk | Description | Probability | Impact | Solution

|*Complications with the project characteristics*
| The team has never worked on the development of a web application and never developed a project with these or similar requirements.
| High
| Very high
| Each member will work individually on the needed technologies for the application to contribute to the overall knowledge of the team. To minimize any 
possible error on the understanding of the requirements, the team will informe the client of any misconception.

|*Problems while using React*
| The team has never worked with the tool React. This would take time from the team which could be invested in advancing the development of the project.
| Very high
| Very high
| The team has compromised to take an in-depth look at the documentation of the tool and practice with it as much as possible.

|*Troubles understanding Solid*
| The team did not know about the existence of Solid and as a consequence has no knowledge about how it works.
| Very high
| Very high
| Every member of the team will sign up in Solid and take the developer tutorial to understand what is the technology and how it should be used.

|*Teamwork issues*
| The members of the team have never worked together. This may cause problems such as lack of communication or trust in each other's work.
| Medium
| Medium
| The team will use the the peer review technique so every member can supervise and contribute to the tasks of the others. Every meeting will 
be summarised in a document so that every member knows the tasks that have been done as well as those pending. Also, the Project tool of GitHub will 
used for a better task planning. Any major problem a member may encounter will be discussed with the rest of the team.

|*Difficulties with web technologies*
| Some of the members have no knowledge about any web technology or programming language. As a consequence they may slow down the team.
| Medium
| High
| Those members will catch up as much as possible with the rest of the team with respect to web technologies.

|*Possible troubles with deadlines*
| The team must meet a series of deadlines and the quality of the deliveries can be affected by the team's lack of total dedication to the project.
| Very high
| High
| The team will follow the planification of the project to avoid backlogs of work.

=== 11.2 Technical Debts

Due to the early stage of development of the project, the technical debt is not tangible enough to be added and, as a consequence, this section will be filled in as we start to create the source code.

.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
ListOfLocations of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.
