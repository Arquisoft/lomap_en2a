[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. These include

* underlying business goals, essential features and functional requirements for the system
* quality goals for the architecture
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
The Council of Brussels has hired the company HappySw, which consists in software architecture students from Oviedo, to develop an application called LoMap.
With LoMap you can access to a map and add markers, routes and share it with your friends. 
Our goal is to develop an application that fullfills the requirements and good quality standards, following SOLID principles ensuring privacy and availability of the data.


=== Requirements Overview
The application shows a map of a city or place. Each user is able to modify it's map to customize and personalized. The users can personalize it's maps by adding 
markers, which can define bars, restaurants, sights, or points of interests from the city. This markers are stored, so that each user, by login in, can access to his personal map.

This storage will be handled according to the SOLID principles.

It's also possible to personalize a map of every city, since this app is not limited by a region or country, and can be accessed from anywhere.

The user requirements are actions that they can do in the application.

.User requirements. The user can: 
* add different categories for each location.
* see the locations in a map in form of markers.
* interact with the locations adding photos, reviews or comments.
* manage a list of friends.
* manage the information that is shared with his friends.
* create personalized routes.(optional)
* compare specific categories. (optional)

.System requirements. The system must:
* store the information about each user's places in his Solid pod, not centralized. 
* allow users to see their friends' markers.
* allow map filtering by categories.
* allow places to create their own pods.(optional)
* be able to create newsfeed from places.(optional)
* add some game features to engage people for discovering new places.(optional)
* allow the creation of maps between groups of users.(optional)
* be able to create place recomendations or check information about them.(optional)
* allow different roles for the users.(optional)
* allow business owners to create opportunities.(optional)

| Goal | Description

| Security | Each user should access to it's pod and it can not be accessed by other user. User can modify their access data.

| Performance | The application should be able to give rationale response time when users are interacting with it. 

| Availability | The personal data from the pods can be accessed at any time.

| Usability | The application should be easy to use. This can be achieved by using different technices such as familiarity, learnability, etc.

| Portability | The application must work regarding the device, since it will be developed as a web application.

| Testability | There must be tests for the application in order to check it's correct behavior.
