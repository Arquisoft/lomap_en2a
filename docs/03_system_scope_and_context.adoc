== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

=== Business Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

****

In our business context, the user will input data into the application, which communicates with the user's SOLID pod to retrieve and add data. 
All this information among with the use of the Google Maps API, will be processed and an output will be recieved by the user. +
The pod will store the user's personal data, and the locations they mark on the map. +
The Google Maps API will provide our application maps, and more functionality like marking places.

The LoMap box is a black box, inside are included all things related to the application itself.

=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

| Technical Interfaces | Description
| SOLID
| Specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called _pods_. These _pods_ are fully under its owner's (the user) control. To use SOLID, a _pod provider_ and a "web ID" are needed. Pods are structures that store the user's data, and the ID identifies the user and allows them to access their pods, and also connect with other SOLID users.
| TypeScript
| Free and open source, developed and mantained by Microsoft. It is the programming language we will use to develop the application. It is derived from JavaScript and implements additional syntax and elements that makes it more complete and in general better than JS. It adds optional static typing and error detection is much easier. As it is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
| ReactJS
| JavaScript open source library that will make it easier to create user interfaces. It shines in applications whose data is always changing. React is the View in the context of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
| Docker
| Platform used to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight _containers_ so that applications can work efficiently in different environments. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
